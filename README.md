# LUAU
## Brendan W. McAdams <bmcadams@novus.com>

Interfaces for [MongoDB][MongoDB] to be used as a valid input & output for [Hadoop][Hadoop] jobs, with the project focus on support for [pig][Pig] (hence the Luau name; that and I couldn't come up with a terse "Elephant Makes Love To a Pig" joke) queries against [MongoDB][MongoDB] (similar to functionality [Cassandra][Cassandra] recently added)

Much of the initial idea for doing this and how to approach it was inspired by [RedBeard0531][RedBeard0531] and a [talk][redbeard-talk] he gave at the Bay Area Hadoop Meetup.

This code is available at both [GitHub][GitHub] and [BitBucket][BitBucket].  BitBucket is the primary repository, with clones pushed to GitHub on a regular basis.
